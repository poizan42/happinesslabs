		<p>Coming from a poor village in India, Sumithra knew she wanted more and she would not let her means determine her future. Not only was she the first from her village to attend the prestigious IIT Madras, but she was the only female in the electronics engineering classes. But Sumi did not stop there. Her passion to lead a meaningful and driven life brought her to Hollywood and eventually her current home, Silicon Valley. Whether it was learning English, starting yoga or moving to another country, Sumi always managed to navigate each challenge with positivity. From her love of life and the magic of technology came the birth of 30daysnew. But 30DaysNew did not come without hardship.</p>
		<p>On September 12, 2012, Sumi received a life altering phone call. Her father, her heart and soul, was in coma and 4 days later he passed. Her world came crashing down, suffocating her. Quickly this optimist spiraled out of control into a world of negativity and pain. Feeling lost, Sumi began writing down all the things she wished she could tell her father and attaching photos. Through the power of words and images Sumi began to find rays of light in her dark world. By the 30th day Sumi no longer cried due to the void in her heart, but smiled because each day she felt closer and closer to her father.</p>
		<p>The death of her father birthed 30DaysNew, a tool that anyone can use to set goals, watch their progress and achieve them. No matter your background or where you come from you are in control of the choices you make and your destiny. Sumithra Jonnalagadda, the CEO of 30DaysNew, believes you are not a product of your environment, but a product of your choices. With the help of 30DaysNew there is nothing you can't achieve!</p>

		<p>I'm a 20-something, goal oriented person who's always looking for ways to make my life better! I'm a radio host at a country music station but I have big dreams to one day host a television show. I'm a lover of chocolate, shoes and all the important people in my life!</p>

		<p>Chrissy is your girl next door with a twist! She grew up in a highly competitive atmosphere with a family full of athletes, which developed her love for sports. She can throw on a jersey, drink a beer and hang with the boys. Or throw on an evening gown, 6-inch heels and compete in a pageant.</p>
			<p>At the age of 17 she began her career as a dancer. Dance became her runway to acting and hosting. Studying with some of the best in the business, having some amazing mentors and booking some cool jobs makes her hungry for success.</p>
			<p>While sports has always been second nature to Chrissy, she recognized that her girlfriends were lost when it came to being able to talk sports (especially with their men!). They simply didn't understand what was going on. This led Chrissy to create Ladies 2 Minute Drill as a way to bridge the gap between sports and women. By using analogies women are able to learn the game, while having fun!</p>
